# Day 9

## Part One

It read much more complex than it actually was - you just follow the algorithm they suggest to get the sequences and then loop through your new found sequences.

Around 40 lines of code made it work - which I was suspicious because the numbers in the input.txt seemed gigantic and I was expecting that to blow up.

But no - it worked!! :D... Now I'm expecting Part two to be awful (or maybe they're taking it easy cause day 8 was kinda hard?)

## Part Two

This seems very easy - probably some piety after Day 8? I'm just adjusting one for loop to add at the end instead of the beginning?

[... codes that for a few minutes ... ]

Yup... that works. Total mercy granted by the AoC powers. I'll take it.
