# Day 11

## Part One

Seems a bit more relaxed than yesterday, but I'm still expecting some bs later on.

For Part One it seems we only need to measure Manhattan distance after checking for the expanded rows and columns, right?

I think you could even math around without having to do the actual expansion.

Let's try that.

BOOM! it worked - and I feel smart because I did it the mathy way B-)

## Part Two 

I expect either a monstruosity OR something very easy after yesterday's which was kinda hard... let's see (Goes and checks website)

HA! OMG it would be very hard *IF* I didn't do the mathy trick, *BUT* with the mathy trick is like, 2 lines difference?

BOOM! yeah bb!!

Remember kids, maths saves lives! :D
