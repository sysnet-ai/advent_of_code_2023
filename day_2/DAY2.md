# Day 2

## Part One
A good reminder to read the instructions correctly hehe - I made a mistake and didn't realize the cubes where *put back* on the bag, so I ended up coding it as if I had to keep track across all the pulls. OOPS :P

This one I just went heavy on map/reduce - split the line, get a bunch of entries in the form 'color number'.

Part One was a bit harder than Day 1's part one I feel

## Part Two

This was the opposite, Part Two of Day 1 was not trivial - and for this one it felt really easy. Just keep track of the maximum amount of cubes shown per color, and that's that.

Again, easy to do with a bunch of map-reduce, and a special appearance by forEach.
