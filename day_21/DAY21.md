# DAY 21

## Part One

After a few of the previous days, day 21 felt easy to begin with. We could just reuse some of the skeleton of a few days to get the basics rolling.

The map seems small enough and the expansion is kinda straight forward, so a basic BFS did the job for us in no time.

OH YEA! :D

## Part Two
Ok, f\*ck you guys
