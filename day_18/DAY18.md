# DAY 18

## Part One
Aaaand we're back to paint buckets :P

I ended up just ripping my own code from Day 10 and adjusting it slightly.

Basically - Follow the instructions, count the places we dug.
Run the paint bucket algorithm, add the size of the bucket (there's only 1 valid contiguous space).

No biggie - however, the 'hex' seems very ominious and I'm sure is gonna be a problem for part Two...
