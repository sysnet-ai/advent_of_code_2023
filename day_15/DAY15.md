# DAY 15

## Part One
Today part one is super straight forward, just create a function that follows the exact instructions they give you, and you're golden.
Split the big string using `split(',')` and then a quick reduce at the very end to sum them all.

EZ PZ... I am worried about part two now :/

## Part Two
It doesn't seem too scary, maybe they're being nice cause it's friday?
Again follow the instructions and use a hashmap, do a bit of book keeping and should be good?
The only thing with the book keeping might be some of the ordering, but I think slices can do most of the heavy lifting for me.

Ok - that worked with almost no adjustments from the original idea. Splice (not slice :/ those are so confusing) does most of the difficult part, but a hash table of lists did it.

Happy Friday!
